# kvaster's gentoo overlay

This repository is my own gentoo overlay - collection of usefull (at least for me) ebuilds.

To be removed when ebuild in main repo will be available with cient building option:
[ ] www-apps/gitea

To be removed when mongodb will be in upstream
[ ] dev-db/mongodb

Upstream have only binary outdated version:
[ ] media-tv/jellyfin

Remove when fixed in main repository
[ ] net-misc/chrome-remote-desktop

Remove if no need for EAP, only stable versions available upstream
[ ] net-wireless/unifi
